# The Official raywenderlich.com Java Style Guide

This style guide is different from other you may see, because the focus is
centered on readability for print and the web. We created this style guide to
keep the code in our tutorials consistent.

Our overarching goals are __conciseness__, __readability__ and __simplicity__.

You should also check out out [Swift](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)
and [Objective-C](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide)
style guides too.

## Nomenclature

On the whole, naming should follow Java standards.

### Packages

Package names are all lower-case, multiple words concatenated together, without
hypens or underscores:

__BAD__:

    com.RayWenderlich.funky_widget

__GOOD__:

    com.raywenderlich.funkywidget


### Classes & Interfaces

Written in UpperCamelCase. For example `RadialSlider`. 

### Methods

Written in lowerCamelCase. For example `setValue`.

### Fields

Written in lowerCamelCase.

Static fields should be written in uppercase, with an underscore separating
words:

    public static final int THE_ANSWER = 42;


### Variables & Parameters

Written in lowerCamelCase.

Single character values to be avoided except for temporary looping variables.

### Misc

In code, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:

__BAD:__

    XMLHTTPRequest
    String URL
    findPostByID

__GOOD:__

    XmlHttpRequest
    String url
    findPostById
