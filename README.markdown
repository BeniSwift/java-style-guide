# The Official raywenderlich.com Java Style Guide

This style guide is different from other you may see, because the focus is
centered on readability for print and the web. We created this style guide to
keep the code in our tutorials consistent.

Our overarching goals are __conciseness__, __readability__ and __simplicity__.

You should also check out out [Swift](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide)
and [Objective-C](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide)
